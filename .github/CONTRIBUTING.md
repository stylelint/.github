# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute.

To help out, you can:

- open new issues about your ideas for making the project better
- get involved in any open issue or pull request
- improve the documentation

## Code contributions

To start coding, you'll need:

- a minimum of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v10, though we do recommend using the latest LTS release
- the latest [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Then:

1. [Fork and clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository.
2. Install all the dependencies with `npm ci`.

### Open a pull request

When you have something to share, it's time to [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

After we review and merge your pull request, we'll invite you to become a maintainer of the stylelint organization. You'll then be able to help manage issues, pull requests and releases. You'll also be able to work on the organizations repositories rather than your forks.

## Financial contributions

We welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/stylelint).

Anyone can file an expense. We will "merge" the expense into the ledger if it makes sense for the development of the community. Open Collective then reimburses the person who filed the expense.

You can financially support us by becoming a:

- [backer](https://opencollective.com/stylelint#backer)
- [sponsor](https://opencollective.com/stylelint#sponsor)
